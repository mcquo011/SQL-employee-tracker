  ## Description 

  The Employee Management System is a command-line application that allows you to manage your company's employee database. It was built using Node.js and MySQL and provides a user-friendly interface to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on departments, roles, and employees.

The application uses the inquirer package to prompt the user for input and the console.table package to display data in a formatted table. The MySQL database is used to store and retrieve data, and the mysql2 package is used to connect to and interact with the database.

The Employee Management System offers the following features:

* View all departments, roles, and employees
* Add a new department, role, or employee
* Update an employee's role

Future development could including adding the option to update managers, view employees by manager and deleting departments, roles, and employees. 


  ## Dependencies  

  * npm install inquirer@8.2.4
  * npm install mysql2
  * npm install console.table

  ## Usage
